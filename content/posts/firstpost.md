I have finally set up a blog. This is where longform things that don't fit on social media will go. There are some things I've done research on or deep-dives into that don't necessarily fit into a social media post or thread. Plus editing and images are a thing. This also has full support for inserting code and syntax highlighting with no JavaScript, which is really nice. Expect a post with actual content in the near future!
