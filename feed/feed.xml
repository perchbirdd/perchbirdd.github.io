    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have finally set up a blog. This is where longform things that don&#39;t fit on social media will go. There are some things I&#39;ve done research on or deep-dives into that don&#39;t necessarily fit into a social media post or thread. Plus editing and images are a thing. This also has full support for inserting code and syntax highlighting with no JavaScript, which is really nice. Expect a post with actual content in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;
